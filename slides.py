        "The primary aim of health-related AI applications is to analyze relationships between prevention or treatment techniques and patient outcomes. "
        "AI programs are applied to practices such as diagnostics, treatment protocol development, drug development, personalized medicine, and patient monitoring and care. "
        "AI systems can be trained using data from various sources such as electronic health records (EHRs), lab results, imaging studies, and genetic profiles. "

        "AI can detect abnormalities in images, such as tumors or fractures, that might be overlooked by the human eye. "
        "In addition to imaging, AI is being used to analyze genetic data and predict the likelihood of developing certain diseases based on genetic markers. "

        "Predictive analytics powered by AI can forecast patient deterioration, readmissions, and other adverse events, allowing for proactive intervention. "
        "AI-driven tools such as virtual health assistants and chatbots provide patients with 24/7 support, answering their questions and helping them manage their conditions. "
